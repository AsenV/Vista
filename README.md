## How It Works

Vista offers a flexible and precise way to simulate how credit cards work, without needing one. Just input a transaction, define how many installments you'd like, and Vista handles the restâ€”distributing values and tracking totals per month.

You can also store front and back images of physical cards (ID, insurance, contacts, etc.) for quick digital access.
